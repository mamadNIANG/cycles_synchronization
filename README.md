# cycles_synchronization
This dissertation analyzes the potential interactions that may exist between cyclical fluctuations in credit, real activity and the currency in France. After an estimation of the cycles by the filter of Hodrick and Prescott (1997), they are characterized by the algorithm of Bry and Boshan over the period from 1993 to 2020. Three methods of analysis of synchronizations between the cycles were used : analysis of turning points, determination of concordances indices and calculation of dynamic cross-correlations between the cyclical components. Our study shows a procyclicality between credit and real activity and also between real activity and money. However, the relationship between credit and money is countercyclical.
